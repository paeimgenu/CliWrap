## The History of Rossi Interarms
 
Rossi Interarms is a brand of firearms that was imported by Interarms of Alexandria, Virginia from the Brazilian manufacturer Amadeo Rossi. Amadeo Rossi was an Italian immigrant who founded his company in 1889 in SÃ£o Leopoldo, Brazil. He started as a tinsmith and later expanded to produce firearms, weapons, and ammunition. His company grew to become one of the largest and most respected arms manufacturers in South America. [^1^] [^4^]
 
In the 1970s, Rossi began to export its firearms to the United States through Interarms, a company that specialized in importing foreign-made guns. Interarms marketed Rossi's revolvers and pistols under the Rossi Interarms brand, and also sold some of Rossi's rifles and shotguns under other names. Rossi Interarms firearms were known for their quality, reliability, and affordability, and gained popularity among American shooters and collectors. [^1^]
 
In 1997, Rossi ended its partnership with Interarms and founded its own subsidiary in North America, BrazTech International. BrazTech became the exclusive importer and distributor of Rossi firearms in the U.S. market. In 2008, Rossi merged with another Brazilian firearms manufacturer, Taurus, which acquired the production line of Rossi's revolvers and handguns. Rossi currently produces only hunting rifles, shotguns, and lever-action rifles under its own brand name, as well as airguns and airsoft guns for the Brazilian market. [^1^]
